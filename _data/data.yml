      "I had the pleasure of working on several projects with Bill, and his technical competence, reliability, humility, 
      and team focus were his standout traits. Bill takes requirements, fills in the gaps, and has already thought 
      about edge cases before most people understand what's being asked. 
      Everyone would vie to have Bill on their team. I recommend him highly!"

      "Bill was a software engineer working on the same projects. I was the Test Director for the F15E simulator program. 
      Bill was knowledgeable, professional, helpful, and always willing to work harder to come up with software issue fixes. 
      Aside from his professionalism and great work ethic, Bill is one of the most friendly and amicable guys I know. 
      A pleasure to work with and a great asset to any program."
