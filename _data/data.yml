      "I worked with Bill at Breeze, where he served as a Senior Software Engineer and I was the Director of Engineering. 
      Bill was a fantastic team member, a strong technical lead, and an overall great person to work alongside. 
      While at Breeze, he took on large, complex projects and was always successful at seeing them through. 

      One of the more complex projects involved rewriting the core query engine powering our platform API. 
      He spent lots of time tracing queries, digging into performance metrics, and ultimately, 
      figuring out and rewriting the code that was causing slow response times from the API. 

      It was an honor and a joy working with Bill and I would highly recommend him for any Senior Engineering roles!"

      "Not only is Bill an intelligent software engineer, he is an excellent teammate. 
      He is always willing to lend a hand, and his positive attitude is infectious. 
      He is a quick learner, an able coach, and a kind person. 
      He would be a great addition to any team."

      "I had the pleasure of working on several projects with Bill, and his technical competence, reliability, humility, 
      and team focus were his standout traits. Bill takes requirements, fills in the gaps, and has already thought 
      about edge cases before most people understand what's being asked. 
      Everyone would vie to have Bill on their team. I recommend him highly!"

      "Bill was a software engineer working on the same projects. I was the Test Director for the F15E simulator program. 
      Bill was knowledgeable, professional, helpful, and always willing to work harder to come up with software issue fixes. 
      Aside from his professionalism and great work ethic, Bill is one of the most friendly and amicable guys I know. 
      A pleasure to work with and a great asset to any program."
